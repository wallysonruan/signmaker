# SignMaker

A browser-based editor for creating and editing signs in **Sutton SignWriting** notation.
Signs are stored and exchanged as **FSW** (Formal SignWriting) strings.

This repository is a ground-up TypeScript rewrite of the original SignMaker 2017.
It is structured as an **npm workspace monorepo** with framework-agnostic core packages
and a Vue 3 adapter. The core packages have no framework dependency and can be used
directly from any other framework.

---

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---|---|
| [`@wallysonruan/signmaker-fsw-engine`](packages/fsw) | Pure TypeScript FSW engine: parse, generate, validate, convert FSW ↔ SWU, symbol key algebra |
| [`@wallysonruan/signmaker-layout-engine`](packages/layout) | Bounding-box calculation, FSW ↔ screen coordinate transforms, sign normalization |
| [`@wallysonruan/signmaker-editor-engine`](packages/editor) | Immutable editor state, commands, undo/redo history, selection, drag engine, keyboard bindings |
| [`@wallysonruan/signmaker-renderer`](packages/renderer) | SVG symbol rendering via Sutton SignWriting TrueType fonts |
| [`@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue`](packages/vue) | Vue 3 composables and components |
| [`app`](app) | Demo application built with Vue 3 + Vite (private, not published) |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install          # install all workspace dependencies
npm run dev          # start the demo app (inside app/)
# or
cd app && npm run dev
```

---

## Demo App

The `app/` directory contains a fully functional Vue 3 editor demonstrating all packages together.
It is **not** published to npm — it exists to show integration and serves as a live testbed.

**Features:**
- Symbol palette with drill-down: groups → base symbols → fill/rotation variants
- Drag symbols from the palette onto the canvas
- Drag to reposition symbols already on the canvas
- Selection handles overlay: rotate CCW/CW, flip horizontal/vertical, copy
- Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) and keyboard nudge (arrow keys)
- FSW panel: displays the current FSW string, accepts FSW input to load a sign

---

## `@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue`

Vue 3 composables and components. Install alongside `vue`:

```bash
npm install @wallysonruan/signmaker-vue
```

### Composables

```typescript
import { useEditorState, useSymbolDrag, useKeyboard } from '@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue';

const { state, canUndo, canRedo, dispatch, replaceState, undo, redo } = useEditorState();
const drag = useSymbolDrag(() => state.value, replaceState, dispatch);
const kb   = useKeyboard(dispatch, undo, redo);
```

### Components

```typescript
import {
  SymbolPalette,    // ISWA 2010 symbol picker with drag support
  SignEditorCanvas, // drag-and-drop canvas with selection handles
  SymbolHandles,    // rotate / flip / copy overlay (used inside SignEditorCanvas)
  FswPanel,         // footer bar with live FSW display and load input
} from '@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue';
```

**`SymbolPalette`** — emits `add-symbol(key: string)` when a symbol is clicked or dropped.

**`SignEditorCanvas`** — props: `state`, `dispatch`, `replaceState`. Handles pointer drag,
HTML5 drag-and-drop from the palette, and renders the `SymbolHandles` overlay automatically.

**`FswPanel`** — props: `fsw`. Emits `load-fsw(fsw: string)` when the user submits a string.

---

## Framework Adapters

`@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue` is the actively maintained framework adapter. The four core packages
(`@wallysonruan/signmaker-fsw-engine`, `@wallysonruan/signmaker-layout-engine`, `@wallysonruan/signmaker-editor-engine`, `@wallysonruan/signmaker-renderer`) are
fully framework-agnostic — they have no Vue dependency and can be consumed directly from React,
Svelte, or any other environment. Adapter contributions for other frameworks are welcome.

---

## `@wallysonruan/signmaker-editor-engine`

Framework-agnostic state management. Core building block for framework adapters.

```typescript
import { EMPTY_STATE, addSymbol, rotateSelected, mirrorSelected,
         copySelected, deleteSelected, selectNone, getSelected,
         createHistory, apply, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo } from '@wallysonruan/signmaker-editor-engine';
```

**State shape:**

```typescript
interface EditorState {
  symbols:   EditorSymbol[];   // ordered array; later = higher z-order
  selection: Set<string>;      // symbol ids currently selected
}

interface EditorSymbol {
  id:  string;   // stable UUID
  key: string;   // 6-char FSW symbol key, e.g. "S14c20"
  x:   number;   // FSW coordinate (0–999, center = 500)
  y:   number;
}
```

**Commands** are pure functions `(state: EditorState) => EditorState`. Pass them to `dispatch`.

---

## `@wallysonruan/signmaker-fsw-engine`

Pure FSW string utilities with no DOM or font dependencies.

```typescript
import { parseFsw, generateFsw, normalizeFsw, fsw2swu, swu2fsw } from '@wallysonruan/signmaker-fsw-engine';
```

**FSW format:** `[A<sort>]? <box><coord> [<sym><coord>]*`

Example: `AS14c20S27106M518x529S14c20481x471S27106503x489`

---

## `@wallysonruan/signmaker-renderer`

Renders individual symbol SVGs using the Sutton SignWriting TrueType fonts.

```typescript
import { renderSymbol, getSymbolSize } from '@wallysonruan/signmaker-renderer';

const svg  = renderSymbol('S14c20');        // returns SVG string
const size = getSymbolSize('S14c20');       // { width, height } | null
```

Rendering requires the Sutton SignWriting fonts to be loaded in the browser.
The `app/` entry point injects the required `@font-face` CSS automatically.

---

## Development

```bash
make install         # install dependencies + activate git hooks
make ci              # full validation: lint, typecheck, test, commitlint
make test            # run all Jest tests
make typecheck       # type-check the Vue package
make lint            # type-check (ESLint target, extend as needed)
make build           # build all packages required for @wallysonruan/signmaker-vue
make release         # build + semantic-release (main branch only)
```

## CI / CD

### Pipeline

```
push (any branch)
    │
    ▼
test
    ├── lint        (make lint)
    ├── typecheck   (make typecheck)
    ├── unit tests  (make test)
    └── commitlint  (make commitlint)
    │
    ▼
release  ← main branch only, after test passes
    └── make release → semantic-release → npm publish @wallysonruan/signmaker-vue
```

GitHub Actions is the orchestrator only. All logic lives in the `Makefile`
and `scripts/`. CI and local execution use the exact same commands.

### Commit Convention

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
Commit messages are validated by `commitlint` via the `commit-msg` Lefthook hook.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Valid scopes: `fsw`, `layout`, `editor`, `renderer`, `vue`, `app`, `ci`, `release`, `deps`.

**Examples:**
```
feat(vue): add symbol rotation composable
fix(editor): prevent drag overflow at canvas boundary
refactor(keyboard): simplify scope registry
docs(readme): update installation guide
chore(deps): upgrade vite to 8.x
```

**Release impact:**
| Commit type | Version bump |
|---|---|
| `feat` | minor |
| `fix`, `perf`, `revert` | patch |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` footer | major |

### Versioning

`@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue` uses [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Versions are determined automatically from commit history on every merge to `main`.
Releases are tagged `vue-vX.Y.Z`, published to npm, and a GitHub release is created
with a generated changelog.

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Auto-provided by GitHub Actions. Creates releases and pushes changelog commits. |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm automation token. Publishes `@wallysonruan/signmaker-vue` to the npm registry. |

### Local Release Process

Releases are normally triggered by CI. To run semantic-release locally in dry-run mode:

```bash
npx semantic-release --dry-run
```

This requires both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` set in your environment.

### Git Hooks (Lefthook)

After `make install`, two hooks are active:

- **`commit-msg`** — runs `commitlint` to reject invalid commit messages immediately.
- **`pre-commit`** — runs `typecheck` and `test` before the commit is recorded.

## FSW Coordinate System

Symbols are placed in a **1000×1000** coordinate space with the logical center at **(500, 500)**.
X increases rightward, Y increases downward.

Screen position is derived as:
```
screen_left = fsw_x − 500 + midWidth
screen_top  = fsw_y − 500 + midHeight
```

where `midWidth`/`midHeight` are half the canvas element's pixel dimensions.
